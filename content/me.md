# General
**current position**: *Engineering manager @ fintech*

**age**: `38`

# Short Summary

A long time ago, in a galaxy not so far away, my story began. I was born with a passion for technology, I was hooked on building things. I spent hours playing Legos and other construction toys, attempting to create something out of nothing. When I had my first glimpse of a PC at the age of 7, it was a game changer.

After graduating from university, I started my professional career, first as a QA engineer, then as a junior software developer.
I spent the next 8 years working as a software developer on various projects, rising from novice to principal engineer.

Along the way, I've worked mostly with technologies like **Ruby**, later adopting the more appropriate **Go** tech stack for better efficiency in distributed environments. This allowed me to gain experience in various **principles**, **conventions** and **patterns**.  I learnt how to design and build efficient facilities, both in terms of engineering and product. The constant struggle between engineering perfection and the business needs became the new norm and was transformed into a **perpetual balance between business expectations and engineering craftsmanship**.

After a certain period of time, I moved from just writing the code to more fundamental activities. Instead of creating features, i started building up the foundation for entire applications. From being responsible only for the small part, i transitioned to being the owner of **delivering the business value**.
My focus changed from pure engineering tasks to managing the very purpose of engineering: delivering impact.

This wasn't something that could have been done by a single person. Every great product requires a team of **exceptional individuals** to follow that journey. It has become an integral part of my professional life to learn techniques for building such teams, creating an prolific environment for all team members and shaping processes to help people achieve our goals. This journey has helped me to understand the value and strength of a **properly structured and motivated team**, and what it is capable of achieving with the right kind of leadership.

The excitement of technology, the potential to contribute to something greater, the desire to create an impact that affects people's lives has helped me in my career. It is a **source of joy, excitement and passion**, not just a 9 to 5 job.

My main responsibility was building up a back-office management subsystem through which clients were able to communicate and resolve their issues. Our main application was the RoR backend(which was built from the ground up aside from the main existing monolith application aggregating all the functionality) for the React Native front application.

Production started in April 2017 and went into alpha-testing and production use in early autumn of 2017. Since the start, I was responsible for the architecture and overall design of backend systems.

Our main backend web stack consisted of rails5, PostgreSQL, Redis, sidekiq, sneakers. With rest-based communication with clients and REST/MQ communication with other services and subsystems.

Apart from that, there were a couple of minor applications written in ruby and elixir which helped to expand available functionality for the core system.
