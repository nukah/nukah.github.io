## General
**current position**: `Engineering manager @ fintech`

**age**: `37`

## Short Summary

My career started with quality assurance, then I moved on to automation, and finally I got into the actual design and implementation of systems.

I've worked with a variety of technologies over the last 13 years, including Ruby, Python, and recently Go. I like its efficiency in distributed, performance-oriented systems. I consider myself well versed in architectural design and software development patterns and conventions. I consider myself a big fan of clean and understandable code.

My expertise includes design and development of high performance `distributed back-end applications`, management of software teams, `mentoring` of junior developers and problem solving. Throughout my career I have successfully managed projects from conception to completion with great results.

I also excel at `designing complex solutions`, optimising code for performance, troubleshooting systems and developing secure applications. I have excellent `communication skills` which enable me to work effectively with those involved at all levels of the organisation.

I have a `passion for technology` and a strong desire to keep abreast of the latest industry trends.

My main responsibility was building up a back-office management subsystem through which clients were able to communicate and resolve their issues. Our main application was the RoR backend(which was built from the ground up aside from the main existing monolith application aggregating all the functionality) for the React Native front application.

Production started in April 2017 and went into alpha-testing and production use in early autumn of 2017. Since the start, I was responsible for the architecture and overall design of backend systems.

Our main backend web stack consisted of rails5, PostgreSQL, Redis, sidekiq, sneakers. With rest-based communication with clients and REST/MQ communication with other services and subsystems.

Apart from that, there were a couple of minor applications written in ruby and elixir which helped to expand available functionality for the core system.
