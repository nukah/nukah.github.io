## General
**current position**: `engineering manager`

**age**: `37`

## Short Summary

I've been working in IT and software development in particular for the last 10 years, starting with QA, then moving to automation, and finally to actual software development.

I've been working with `Ruby/Rails` stack for the last 10 years. Lately, I've been using `Go` more because of its efficiency in distributed performance-oriented systems. I consider myself proficient in architecture design, software development patterns, and conventions. Considering myself a big fan of clean and comprehensible code.

My expertise includes designing and developing high-load distributed backend applications, leading software teams, mentoring junior developers, and problem solving. Throughout my career, I have successfully managed projects from conception to completion with great results.

I specialize in software architecture, problem solving, team management and mentoring. My strengths also include designing complex algorithms, optimizing code for performance, troubleshooting system issues, and developing secure applications. In addition to this, I have excellent communication skills which enable me to effectively collaborate with stakeholders from all levels of the organization.

I am passionate about technology and have a strong desire to stay up-to-date with the latest trends in the industry.

Our main backend web stack consisted of rails5, PostgreSQL, Redis, sidekiq, sneakers. With rest-based communication with clients and REST/MQ communication with other services and subsystems.

Apart from that, there were a couple of minor applications written in ruby and elixir which helped to expand available functionality for the core system.
